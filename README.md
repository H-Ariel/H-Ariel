# 👋 Hi, I'm Ariel  

👀 I'm passionate about low-level programming in **C/C++** and **WinAPI**, and also enjoy working with **C#**, **Python**, and full-stack development using **Node.js** and **React**.  

🌱 I'm currently studying **Computer Science**.  

🗄️ I have experience with databases such as **SQL** and **MongoDB**.  

💡 I also know and use additional languages and technologies, but prefer to keep it short here.
